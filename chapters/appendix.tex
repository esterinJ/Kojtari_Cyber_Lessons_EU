\section{Figure \ref{eurlex.png}:}
The figure shows the results of the simulation conducted using the \texttt{Simulator} package in \textsf{R}. The simulation was run for 1000 iterations with a step size of 0.1. The simulation parameters used are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Parameter 1: 0.5
  \item Parameter 2: 0.2
  \item Parameter 3: 0.8
\end{itemize}

The code used to generate this figure is shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
# R code to generate Figure 1
sim_results <- Simulator::run_simulation(iterations = 1000, step_size = 0.1,
                                         param1 = 0.5, param2 = 0.2, param3 = 0.8)

plot(sim_results)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Figure 2: Data Visualization}
Figure 2 displays a scatter plot of the data collected from the survey conducted in June 2023. The data was collected from a sample of 500 participants, and the x-axis represents their age, while the y-axis represents their satisfaction level. The data used to create this figure is available in the file \texttt{survey_data.csv}.
